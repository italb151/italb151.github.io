        <h2>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying Business Admin with a minor in photography. I work for Rainsford Photography as a marketing intern.</p>
         <p>
            Photography may be my career choice but I also love several other hobbies. Reading, watching well crafted films, and listening to music are all passions of mine.

            I don't know what else to put here so...my great grandfather guided Teddy Roosevelt on an African Safari. This has zero bearing on my life but gives me an interesting fact whenever people ask for those things.
